## SAPUI5 Object Classification

Enhanced experience for class/classification in SAP S4 HANA. This application is based on the idea of the Migration Cockpit's object classification app. The main objective of this application is to provide grounds for having an enhanced user experience in the classification system usage, an important but often neglected functionality due to the current S4 transaction-based experience being a bit clunky.

Therefore, using SAPUI5 to develop a new, custom and fresh application following Fiori guidelines is interesting to keep those users active in the application.

### Features
